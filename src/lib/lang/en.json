            "p3": "At the beginning, there is a short preparation phase in which you should look at a fixation cross on the screen. This is followed by the presentation of an image (5 seconds), followed by a start signal indicating that you should start walking.",

If the picture represents something good or positive, please use the right side of the scale to mark your answer. Positive images are those that represent things that make us happy, satisfied, competent, proud, contented, delighted, and so on. It doesn’t matter what the specific picture is about, as long as it represents something positive or good.",
            "p4": "If the picture represents something bad or negative, please use the left side of the scale to mark your answer. Negative images are those that represent things that make us unhappy, upset, irritated, angry, sad, depressed, and so on. It doesn’t matter what the specific picture is about, as long as it is something negative or bad.",

In other words, we would like to know how much emotional intensity the picture creates; whether the picture captures something good or bad doesn’t matter. We are interested only in the degree of excitement, energy, or intensity of feeling it represents.",
            "p2": "Use the right side of the scale to mark your answer if the picture represents something that is strongly emotional. The words that we might use to describe the emotional state that the picture creates are aroused, alert, activated, charged, or energized.",
            "p3": "Use the left side of the scale to mark your answer if the picture represents something that is not strongly emotional. The words that we might use to describe the emotional state that the picture creates are unaroused, slow, still, de-energized, calm, or peaceful.",
            "p4": "Use the middle of the scale to indicate an image that is moderately arousing or halfway through the two extremes."
