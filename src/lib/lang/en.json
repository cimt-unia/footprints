            "p2": "Each round corresponds to one trial.",
            "p3": "At the beginning, there is a short preparation phase in which you should look at a fixation cross on the screen. This is followed by the presentation of an image (5 seconds), followed by a start signal indicating that you should start walking.",

            "p3": "We will ask you to rate a series of images according to how positive or negative they are. If the image represents something good or positive, please use the right side of the scale to mark your answer. Positive images are those that depict things that make us happy, satisfied, competent, proud, fulfilled, pleased, etc. It does not matter what the specific image is about, as long as it represents something positive or good.",
            "p4": "If the image represents something bad or negative, please use the left side of the scale to mark your answer. Negative images are those that depict things that make us unhappy, annoyed, irritated, angry, sad, etc. It does not matter what the specific image is about, as long as it represents something negative or bad.",
            "p5": "Use the middle of the scale to indicate that the image makes you feel neutral, i.e., neither positive nor negative. Please use the entire range of the scale for your answers, rather than limiting yourself to just a few points."

In other words, we want to know how intensely the image generates emotions; it does not matter if the image represents something good or bad. We are only interested in the degree of arousal, energy, or intensity of the feeling it represents.",
            "p2": "Use the right side of the scale if the image represents something that is highly emotional. Words describing the emotional state created by the image could be, for example, 'excited', 'alert', 'activated', 'charged', or 'energized'.",
            "p3": "Use the left side of the scale if the image represents something that is not strongly emotional. Words describing the emotional state could be, for example, 'unaroused', 'slow', 'calm', 'lacking energy', 'relaxed', or 'peaceful'. Use the middle of the scale to mark an image that is moderately arousing or lies between the two extremes.",
            "p4": "Please use the entire range of the scale for your answers, rather than limiting yourself to just a few points. When rating, you should forget whether the image represents something positive or negative, good or bad. Rate the image solely based on the intensity of the emotions it triggers.",
            "p5": "Example: You have two images – one shows an athlete winning a gold medal (something good), and another shows an athlete getting injured and losing the race (something bad). You can give both images the same rating because they generate a similar emotional intensity, even though the feelings are different. Your answers should depend solely on how strong the emotions are that the image evokes."
